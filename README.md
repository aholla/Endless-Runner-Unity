# Endless-Runner-Unity

An "endless runner" style game build in Unity.

The game is a simple linear game, you control the character and swing them from left to right to collect pickups whilst avoiding obstacles.

As the player moves throught the world, the camera follow and level pieces are spawn and culled.
